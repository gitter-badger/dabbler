Dabbler - The UML and SysML Modeling Tool
===============================================

Dabbler is a open source UML and SysML modeling tool, written in Python.

The project was just renamed from Gaphor, and there is heavy work in progress to fully support Python3 and use the OS native GUI toolkit called Toga.

To install simply type:

  $ pip install dabbler
  
Dabbler is licensed under the GPLv2, and help is welcome and appreciated.
